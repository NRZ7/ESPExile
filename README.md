---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a fork from CoftSock ESP Exile Stats.

http://www.exilemod.com/topic/1538-esp-exile-stats-page-system-60updated/

Please, follow the original liscence and contact with the Main developer for any doubt about this.

I only made a few modifications to make Exile 1.0.2 Comatible and little look modifications with Coftsock permission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Id like to thank those who have helped me through bug finding, themes, improvements, suggestions and donations.

Installation:
Firstly i recommend running a simple Apache server on the same instance(server) that you have your database. as i hate configuring external mysql database connections + user and will not help you with that.

extract the contents of exile_stats_page6_mini to the web directory you want.

edit "config/details.php" with your database details.

you're now done, enjoy bye!



Go ahead and edit the theme (css) if you think i have no idea in style, report any bugs or give suggestions to me on the forums (coftsock) or on skype: coftsock
